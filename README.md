                                      My Process
a) I create the new repository and give it my slack username : AAJUNIOR88
b) I created a folder and a file on my PC and name it index.html
c) I wrote some code in the file index.html.
d) I opened my command line (Git Bash)
e) I clone the aajunior88 repository into the folder created on my PC
f) I git add, git commit and git push the file Index.html
Note : This is so because a branch cannot be created on an empty repository (Master), 
An empty file can be sent but i chose to put in some code.
g) I created a branch named MAIMUNA and 
f) I updated the index.html file and Push to MAIMUNA branch.
